DigitNumber-CNN

A simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) project implemented in MATLAB for recognizing handwritten digits (0–9).  
This model uses MATLAB’s built-in digit dataset and achieves around 90% accuracy.

 Features
- Loads digit training and test data
- Builds a lightweight CNN architecture
- Trains and evaluates the model
- Displays prediction results on random test images

 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/efeaaksakal21/DigitNumber-CNN.git
